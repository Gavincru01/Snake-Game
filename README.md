## Arcade Hub

Arcade Hub is a web app I’m building with Angular that brings together classic-style games in one place.
Each game opens inside its own “arcade cabinet” with a neon theme.

## Current Games

Snake Game – the classic snake that grows as you eat fruit.

Difficulty selector (Easy / Medium / Hard)

High score saving

Neon arcade cabinet UI

Pong - Player vs. AI paddle match

Difficulty dropdown (affects win condition / challenge)

First to reach the winning score wins

Neon arcade cabinet style with custom color palette

## Planned Games

Tetris

More arcade classics to come...

## Tech Stack

Angular (standalone components)

TypeScript

HTML Canvas API

CSS for styling (neon arcade look)

## Run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arcade-hub.git
cd arcade-hub
npm install
ng serve
```

## Features of the Hub

## Future Plans
